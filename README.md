# Pesca: a computational method to predict and enhance spatial profiling of chromatin accessibility
## Introduction
Pesca is a computational method to predict and enhance spatial profiling of chromatin accessibility using scATAC-seq data.The accuracy and generalizability of the Pesca-enhanced and -predicted data are validated by existing various ground-truth data including spatial co-profiling data, VISTA results, and epigenomic MEIFISH data.
